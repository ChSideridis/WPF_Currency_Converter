# WPF_Currency_Converter

To convert one currency into another, all you need to do is enter an amount of money (e.g., ‘1000’) and choose the currency and select the monetary value (e.g. “United States Dollar”). You can try with the multiple monetary selections. The application then calculates the entered amount with the exchange value and displays the corresponding amount of money.
